# Email-Spam-Detection
Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte, addresses the pressing issue of spam emails inundating inboxes with unsolicited and often malicious content. This project leverages machine learning to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying and filtering spam emails, providing a valuable solution to enhance digital communication security.

The project began with extensive data preprocessing, where a large email dataset was cleaned, structured, and prepared for analysis. Key features indicative of spam were extracted using advanced techniques, ensuring the data was suitable for model training. Various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees and support vector machines, were employed to train and evaluate the model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess its performance comprehensively.

To further improve the modelâ€™s accuracy, hyperparameter tuning and rigorous cross-validation were conducted. The final model demonstrated strong generalization to new, unseen data, highlighting its effectiveness. Deployment strategies were also explored to integrate the model into real-world email filtering systems, showcasing its practical applicability. This project exemplifies the use of data science and machine learning to address real-world challenges and deliver impactful solutions.
